Not really an INSTALL file as there is nothing to install. This is a
LaTeX document and you can render it to PDF by running

  make

Currently it depends on the following software:

  make, to manage dependencies
  LilyPond, to typeset the music
  LaTeX, to typeset the document
  pdftk, to split an example into four pages

I am aware that file names are in Spanish, but it is a document in
Spanish, anyway.  If you'd like to maintain a translation, we could
host it in the same project.
